Hello, I'm Malik Washington. I've worked at Fedex,MetroPcs and places like DHL for the year. I graduated 2019 with a gpa above an 3.2. I love boosting my knowledge, and seeing others do the same. I hate that we are viewed as the dumbest race. i love to prove the world wrong not far as saying anyone should be, but embracing our minds. I just want this to be a way we all impact the world.
