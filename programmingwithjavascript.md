JavaScript programming is like a car you have your operating system like Assignment operators
Comparison operators,and
Arithmetic operators these are just a few.

Assignment operators -assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal =, which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

Comparison operators -compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. To type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !== operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons.

Arithmetic operators -Takes numerical values either literals or variables as their operands and returns a single numerical value. Standard arithmetic operators are addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, and division /.

Relational operators - compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.
