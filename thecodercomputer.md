During the time when I first started out learning about web development, one
thing that I felt a need to do was to download a text editor.s 
I was all over YouTube for how to do this in and that in coding videos, it
seemed that each coding video I watched, the instructor always
seemed to use a different text editor.
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site.
